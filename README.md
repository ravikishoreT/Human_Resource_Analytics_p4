## Dashboard Overview
This project is focused on conducting a comprehensive analysis of absenteeism within the organization, aiming to identify trends, patterns, and underlying factors contributing to employee absences. By leveraging HR analytics, we seek to understand how absenteeism varies across different positions, departments, and demographics, providing valuable insights into workforce dynamics. The analysis will utilize various visualization techniques, including heat maps and trend lines, to present data in an accessible and actionable format. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to equip HR professionals with the necessary tools and insights to develop effective strategies for reducing absenteeism, enhancing employee engagement, and fostering a more productive work environment. Through this focused approach, we aim to contribute to the overall health and performance of the organization.
